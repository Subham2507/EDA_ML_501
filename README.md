# Car Sales Data Analysis
This project involves comprehensive analysis of car sales data through both univariate and multivariate techniques.

### Univariate Analysis
In this section, various individual features of the dataset were explored to understand their distributions, central tendencies, and variations. Key statistics and visualizations were employed to reveal insights about car prices, fuel types, and other relevant attributes.

### Multivariate Analysis
This part of the project delves into the relationships between multiple variables. Using correlation matrices and visualizations, we examined how different factors, such as fuel type and car features, interact with one another and impact sales performance.

The findings from both analyses provide valuable insights for stakeholders looking to make data-driven decisions in the car sales industry.
